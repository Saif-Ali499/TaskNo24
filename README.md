# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Brief overview of the decisions made during the enhancement process:- The steps I followed in this project that I initially make the different files for each component of the page. And after that I decide to share the data between them by using the concept of context Api for that I made context folder in which i made a file with the name DataContext.js in which I decide which data should be shared between the different components. I also use the concept of the react-router-dom in it to render the different componets alternatively
